# SeaCourses

SeaCourses is an alternative course search system for Stony Brook University. We've always found searching for classes on the official systems a cumbersome process. SeaCourses allows students to quickly search for classes with multiple filters, as well as see what their schedule might look like based on their selected classes.

Because there is no API for such data, all course data is retrieved by using a converted text version of the official [course catalog PDF](http://www.stonybrook.edu/registrar/class-schedules.shtml). Course registration numbers come from the official [SBU Class Find](http://classfind.stonybrook.edu/vufind/).
